                            We want you to always be hydrated because it’s good for your overall health
                            and your skin, but especially for your tattooing or permanent make up appointment!

                        <p>
                            We can always benefit from removing impurities from our skin and moisturizing but 
                            this is especially helpful leading up to your appointment.  Please do not moisturize
                            or exfoliate immediately before your appointment as it can irritate the skin or cause
                            complications with the tattoo machine.

                            up service! Try to get a good nights sleep prior to your appointment so your body can 
                            heal properly.

                        <p>
                            Drugs and alcohol can inhibit the bodies natural healing process, cause complications
                            during your appointment, and effect the quality of your tattoo.

                            Please make sure you arrive at your appointment with a full belly! Getting tattooed uses a 
                            lot of the bodies energy, and can cause fatigue or may even make you pass out on an empty 
                            stomach.  Did you know? your body actually is able to handle pain better when you aren't hungry!

                        <h2>What is permanent make up?</h2>
                        <p>Permanent makeup refers to cosmetic tattoos that help you
                           recreate your favorite makeup looks in a semi-permanent.</p>

                        <h2>Do I have to shave my eyebrows off?</h2>
                        <p>NOOOOOO! The coolest thing about cosmetic tattooing on the brows 
                           is that it naturally blends your natural brow hairs in with the machine strokes! </p>

                    <li>
                        <h2> When do I need it touched up?</h2>
                        <p>Typically results last about 2-3 years before needing touched up. </p>

                        <h2>Does it hurt? </h2>
                        <p>It may be uncomfortable, but we use a topical anesthetic to numb the 
                            area and reduce discomfort. </p>

                           discuss the shape, size, color,  and style with each client.  </p>
